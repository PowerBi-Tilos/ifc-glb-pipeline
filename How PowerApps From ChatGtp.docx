Great catch ‚Äî let me walk you through exactly how to use that iframe snippet inside Power Apps, including all the steps so nothing is left unclear.

üß© How to Embed the Babylon.js Viewer in Power Apps
You‚Äôll use the iframe code to embed your GitHub-hosted Babylon viewer directly in your Power App. Here's how:

‚úÖ Prerequisites
You‚Äôve already completed:

.ifc file uploaded to input/

.glb and index.html deployed to GitHub Pages

Example viewer URL is:

arduino
Copy code
https://powerbi-tilos.github.io/ifc-glb-pipeline/
üß≠ Step-by-Step in Power Apps
üñº Option A: Use the ‚ÄúHTML Text‚Äù control (Most flexible)
Open your Canvas App in Power Apps Studio.

In the Insert pane, search for "HTML text" and add it to your screen.

In the HtmlText property, paste:

html
Copy code
<iframe src="https://powerbi-tilos.github.io/ifc-glb-pipeline/" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
Resize the control to fit your layout.

‚úÖ Your GLB viewer is now live inside Power Apps!

üß± Option B: Use a PCF Control or Web Viewer Component
For more advanced use cases (like bidirectional interaction or dynamic URL binding), you can:

Use the Web Viewer control (from the "Modern controls")

Or build a PCF (PowerApps Component Framework) control if you need deeper integration.

But for most use cases, the HTML Text control is sufficient and quick.

üß© Bonus: Dynamic Viewer per Record (Optional)
You can make the iframe change dynamically, e.g., when selecting a model from a gallery:

html
Copy code
<iframe src="https://powerbi-tilos.github.io/ifc-glb-pipeline/?model=" & Gallery1.Selected.ModelFileName & ".glb" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
Assumes your Babylon viewer supports query params like ?model=xyz.glb. I can help you extend the index.html viewer to support that if you'd like.

üîç Summary
Task	Tool
Embed static viewer	HTML Text control
Dynamically change model	HTML + expression binding
Advanced integration	Web Viewer / PCF control

Would you like help with:

Making the Babylon viewer support dynamic model loading via ?model=xyz.glb?

Adding controls in Power Apps to filter or interact with GUIDs?

Let me know and we can deepen this integration further.
